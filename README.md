# Conjoint-Analysis
Conjoint analysis project on student’s preferences for colleges and the factors that influence the student’s school selection. The target group was prospective or active students and recent graduates with an average age of 21 and a range from 18 - 24. There are many factors to consider when determining what influences students to select certain schools so I decided to focus on four of them. The important attributes we identified were the tuition costs, the number of enrolled students, the acceptance rate, and the school location. 
Activities done on the dataset:
